System Setup
============

This repository contains a number of useful configurations in their simplest form, as well as a `setup.sh` script which can be run in order to install a number of useful packages automatically whenever working with a fresh operating system.

Included here are configurations for [tmux](https://tmux.github.io/), [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), and Vim.
